## Introduction

Hi there!  I'm Tegar Alwinata Masyhuda, and this repository showcases my personal portfolio.  I'm a versatile tech enthusiast with experience in a wide range of areas, from Machine Learning and Web Development to UI/UX Design, Data Analysis, and ICT training. I'm passionate about solving problems, building innovative solutions, and constantly expanding my skillset.  This portfolio highlights my key projects, experiences, skills, and contributions.  I like to think of myself as a "Jack of all Trades" in the tech world!

This portfolio website is built using:

*   **Laravel** (PHP Framework) -  The backend logic and routing are handled by Laravel.
*   **Tailwind CSS** -  The styling and responsive design are primarily achieved with Tailwind CSS utility classes.
*   **Alpine.js** - This is used for lightweight JavaScript interactivity within the Blade templates.  The `x-data` attributes would be where Alpine is used.
*   **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)** -  Used for creating animations and scroll-triggered effects, enhancing the visual appeal of the portfolio.
*   **Anime.js** - Another JavaScript animation library, used for the text animations like the "flicker" effect.
* **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**:  The foundation of the web page.

## Features

*   **Hero Section:**  The landing page features an interactive card display.
*   **Experience Section:** Details my professional experiences.
*   **Projects Section:**  A grid layout to showcase various projects. *
*   **Organization & Certification Section:**  Highlights my involvement in organizations (LPM FST UNAIR, BEM UNAIR), volunteering experiences (HIMSI UNAIR, AMERTA UNAIR), and a list of certifications and courses taken.
